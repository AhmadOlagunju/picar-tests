Tests for various picar experiments using a raspberry pi 3

# Introduction

I sourced most parts from the sunfounder picar-s kit and I use a raspberry pi to operate the vehicle. Here is the finished build equipped with an ultrasonic sensor:

I plan on making the car self-driving using tensorflow and a neural network this repository will be updated as I work on the project.

# Ultrasonic Avoidance Test
Here is a demo video of the ultrasonic avoidance module. The car avoids any obstacles that are near it by backing up or swerving. The code is included in this repository.
